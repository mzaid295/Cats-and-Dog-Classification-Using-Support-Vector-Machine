Project Description:

Create a Cat and Dog Classification Model using traditional ML algorithms with these steps:

Acquire 300 images (100 cats, 100 dogs, and 100 unrelated images) from sources like Kaggle.
Split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from the images.
Use folder names as labels for the images.
Train a Machine Learning algorithm (e.g., SVM, Decision Tree) of your choice and save the model.
Fine-tune the model using Grid Search.
Develop a testing script to evaluate the model's performance.
Required Libraries:

You will use Python and the following libraries: OpenCV, scikit-learn, scikit-image, imutils, and NumPy.

Deliverables:

Provide the following deliverables:

Python code files for training and testing.
The trained machine learning model.
A short document explaining your algorithm choice and project flow.

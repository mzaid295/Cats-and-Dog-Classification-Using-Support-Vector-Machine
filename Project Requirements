• Develop a Cat and Dog Classification Model using traditional ML algorithms 
• Involved Steps 
• Get 100 Images of Cat, 100 images of Dogs, 100 quite different images. 
• Can get data from Kaggle Split them in 80% for the training and 20% for the testing 
• Read images from the folder and extract their HOG features Read labels of the image, 
• which will be folder name of the images Train ML algorithm like SVM. 
• Decision Tree or any other of your choice and save the model Tune the Model Using Grid Search Develop Testing Script of the model 
• Involved Libraries This course mainly uses Python, specifically the OpenCV, skleam, sklmage,imutils and numpy libraries. 
• No prior experience is required as this Guided Project is designed for complete beginners. 
• Deliverables Python Code Files (training and testing file) Trained Model 
• Short Document (Explaining your choice of Algorithm and project flow)
